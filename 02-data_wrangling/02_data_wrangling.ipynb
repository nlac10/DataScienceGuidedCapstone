It also does not have a strong sense of what facilities matter most to visitors, particularly which ones they're most likely to pay more for. This project aims to build **a predictive model** for ticket price based on a number of facilities, or properties, boasted by resorts (*at the resorts). This model will be used to provide guidance for Big Mountain's pricing and future facility investment plans."

    "**Notebooks grow organically as we explore our data.** If you used paper notebooks, you could discover a mistake and cross out or revise some earlier work. Later work may give you a reason to revisit earlier work and explore it further. The great thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can edit, add, and move cells around without needing to cross out figures or scrawl in the margin. However, this means you can lose track of your changes easily. If you worked in a regulated environment, the company may have a a policy of always dating entries and clearly crossing out any mistakes, with your initials and the date.\n",

    "**Best practice here is to commit your changes using a version control system such as Git.** Try to get into the habit of adding and committing your files to the Git repository you're working in after you save them. You're are working in a Git repository, right? If you make a significant change, save the notebook and commit it to Git. In fact, if you're about to make a significant change, it's a good idea to commit before as well. Then if the change is a mess, you've got the previous version to go back to.\n",

    "So far you've examined only the numeric features. Now you inspect categorical ones such as resort name and state. These are discrete entities. 'Alaska' is a name. Although names can be sorted alphabetically, it makes no sense to take the average of 'Alaska' and 'Arizona'. Similarly, 'Alaska' is before 'Arizona' only lexicographically; it is neither 'less than' nor 'greater than' 'Arizona'. As such, they tend to require different handling than strictly numeric quantities. \n",

    "> **Note, a feature _can_ be numeric but also categorical.** For example, instead of giving the number of `fastEight` lifts, a feature might be `has_fastEights` and have the value 0 or 1 to denote absence or presence of such a lift. In such a case it would not make sense to take an average of this or perform other mathematical calculations on it. Although you digress a little to make a point, month numbers are also, strictly speaking, categorical features. Yes, when a month is represented by its number (1 for January, 2 for Februrary etc.) it provides a convenient way to graph trends over a year. And, arguably, there is some logical interpretation of the average of 1 and 3 (January and March) being 2 (February). However, clearly December of one years precedes January of the next and yet 12 as a number is not less than 1. \n",

    "**The numeric quantities in the section above are truly numeric; they are the number of feet in the drop, or acres or years open or the amount of snowfall etc.**"

    "This suggests one might expect prices to be similar amongst them. You can look into this. A boxplot grouped by State is an ideal way to quickly compare prices. Another side note worth bringing up here is that, **in reality, the best approach here definitely would include consulting with the client or other domain expert.** They might know of good reasons for treating states equivalently or differently. The data scientist is rarely the final arbiter of such a decision. But here, you'll see if we can find any supporting evidence for treating states the same or differently."

Some States, notably North Carolina and Virginia, have weekend prices far higher than weekday prices. \n",

    "\n",
    "**TARGET VARIABLE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **target variable** is `AdultWeekend` ticket price because we want to predict how much BMR should charge for admission. \n",
    "\n",
    "The original data reported two ticket types: `AdultWeekday` and `AdultWeekend`. Because resorts with **no prices** are of no use to us, we **drop those rows** which account for ~14% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our state of interest (Montana) has both `AdultWeekday` and `AdultWeekend`ticket prices but because there is no price difference, there's no reason to prefer one feature over the other. \n",

    "- `TerrainParks`\n",
    "- `SkiableTerrain_ac`\n",
    "- `daysOpenLastYear`\n",
    "- `NightSkiing_ac`\n",

    "**OTHER ISSUES**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duplicates:** At first glance, *Crystal Mountain Resort* seemed to be a duplicate. But after considering uniqueness of both state and region, turns out there are two resorts with the same name but in different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nulls:** `fastEight` and `NightSkiing_ac` were missing **~50% and ~43%** data respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Looking closer at `fastEight`, **99% of the reported values are actually 0** which means the values are also missing even though calling null on them returns `False`. Because this feature doesn't provide any useful input, we **drop the entire column.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Although `NightSkiing_ac` is missing a good amount of data, it is one of our features of interest and so we decide to keep it and explore further. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outliers/Skewness:** Plotting the distribution of features helped reveal which resorts require further investigating. Through this, we discover not only incorrect values due to **human error** and but also allowed us to validate data and determine if the resort should be corrected, kept, or removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. **Data Correction:** A specific example of an **outlier** is *Silverton Mountain* where `SkiableTerrain_ac` reports 26819 when looking at its website it should be 1819. We determine the discrepancy is due to either human error or lost in translation. The value is **corrected to 1819.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. **Data Validation:** *Heavenly Mountain Resort's* shows an **outlier** for its `SkiableTerrain _ac` reporting 4800 but we find that this info is valid after learning that `Snow Making_ac` accounts for 60% of skiable terrain. \n",
